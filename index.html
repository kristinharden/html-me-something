        <h2>Christmas Lights>
      		  <p>I am incredibly thankful to be the mommy of two boys. My wonderful boys, Robbie and Gig. The sweetest two boys who ever lived.
              Who are a total, complete, unmitigated disaster.
    		    <br>Robbie is the big brother. He thinks he is the boss of his baby brother, Gig. He is often mistaken.
    		    <br>Take today for example. Hanging our lights used to be a relatively straightforward task that took an hour or so before I had kids.
            Cut to post babies and today was the third day we'd been working on decorating our house.
            We had already spent six hours on it, and we still weren't done.
    		    <br>I decided that today was the day to finally get the Christmas lights finished - no matter what.
            The boys decided that the best thing to do while mommy was trying to put up the Christmas lights was to strip off one of the baby's shoes somewhere in the yard, to hide them, and to run through all of the mud they could find. Then they took out every toy in the garage and tossed them in the neighbor's yards. Fortunately, they didn't eat any of the Christmas lights.
            Which seemed like a distinct possibility for a few minutes.
    		    <br>Next time I think I'm the boss, I'll have to remember that I'm probably mistaken too.

          <h2>Study Time</h2>
            <p>Example&#8209;number&#8209;next of their chaos.
            <br> As I am typing, Robbie is climbing behind me into my desk chair to try to hug me. Giggy carried his dragon puppet over and pretended to make it bite me to get my attention. And then he put it into timeout because "teeth are for food, not people."
            <br> Under all the crazy, these sweet little souls just want love and attention from their momma. And she needs an hour or two to get her homework finished.
